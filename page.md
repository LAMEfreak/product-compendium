## List of Product Metrics

### Daily Active Users (DAU)

DAU is utilized as a high-level metric to measure the level of daily user engagement with a product. Depending on the context, Weekly Active Users (WAU) or Monthly Active Users (MAU) may be used.

For instance, a telehealth mobile application may consider an active user to be one who logs in and completes a remote telemedicine consultation. Given that users are unlikely to schedule consultations daily, utilizing MAU as a metric might be more appropriate.

It is important to define a meaningful action to qualify an 'active user' in the context of the product. For example:

* For a music streaming application (e.g. Spotify), a user is qualified as active if > 15 mins of music tracks is streamed
* For a form building application, a user is qualified as active if a new form is created (and / or published)
* For an internal communications tool (e.g. Slack), a user is qualified as active if the user sends a message
